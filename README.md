          VBA Challenge desscription

For this project, I created a VBA (Visual Basic) script to analyze some stock market data. The data is inside a Microsoft Excel workbook.
Due to the size of the Excel workbook, I was not able to upload that file to this GitHub repository.
I ran this script on both the testing Excel workbook (alphabetical_testing.xlsx) and on the final multiple year stock workbook (multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx).
My environment is Windows 10, Microsoft Excel 365. So, the script should work if you are using this environment. Not sure about Macs though, as I didn't test the script on a Mac.
